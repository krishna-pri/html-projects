    <h2><u>Sukhasana</u></h2>

    <p>Also known as the Easy Pose, Sukhasana is a posture that you’re probably already using unconsciously. To
        mindfully
        practice, it can unfurl benefits ranging from calm and inner peace, relieving exhaustion and mental stress, and
        improving overall posture and balance. Sit cross-legged on the floor, the legs crossing at the shins. Each foot
        should
        be under the opposite knee. Keep the spine elongated and straight, in line with the neck and head. Keep the
        hands on the
        knees either in chin mudra or with the palms facing down. Close your eyes, inhale and exhale deeply, and hold
        for 2-3
        minutes. Then change sides, putting the leg that was on top below. Repeat.</p>

    <h2><u>Tadasana</u></h2>
    <p>The Mountain Pose or Tadasana is the foundation of all standing postures, and helps decrease anxiety by improving
        breath
        control, and enabling you to feel more secure and grounded. Stand with your feet directly under your hips, body
        straight
        and in alignment, weight spread evenly. Raise your arms over your head, then interlock your fingers with the
        palms
        facing upwards. As you do this, gently lift your body onto your toes, and inhale. You can roll the shoulders
        back a
        little, opening out your chest. Hold this posture for 3-4 counts, along with your breath. Exhale as you release
        the same
        way you got into the pose – bringing your hands to the sides of your body, and the heels back on the floor.
        Repeat 10-12
        times.</p>

    <h2><u>Balasana</u></h2>
    <p>Balasana or the Child’s Pose has a direct impact on the nervous and lymphatic system, easing stress and fatigue
        and
        keeping the mind quiet and calm. To practice balasana, kneel with your legs together, and then sit back with
        your hips
        resting on your heels. Without lifting your hips, gently bend forward, till your chest is resting on your
        thighs, and
        your forehead touches the floor (you can use a pillow for the first few times). You can keep your arms by your
        side,
        palms pointing upwards, or stretch them out in front of you if you need the extra support.</p>
    <br>

    <h2><u>Setubandasana</u></h2>
    <p>Also known as the bridge pose, setubandasana can address issues like insomnia, anxiety and migraines. It is also
        great
        to control the blood pressure and keep backaches at bay. Lie on your back, and bend your knees. The feet should
        be
        directly under the knees, hip-width apart. The arms should be on the sides of the body, palms facing down.
        Gently inhale
        and lift your hips, keeping your feet and arms firmly on the floor, and not moving your knees. Use your butt
        muscles to
        keep pushing the hips up higher – do not strain your back. Hold to 5 counts, then exhale and slowly release the
        hips
        downwards till you’re back to the starting position. Repeat a few times every day.</p>

    <h2><u>Shavasana</u></h2>
    <p>Shavasana or the corpse pose, practised at the end of a yoga session, makes you mindful of your breathing,
        lowering
        stress and hypertension, ensuring enhanced focus and mental wellbeing and keeping depression at bay. Lie down on
        your
        back, legs slightly apart, arms around 6 inches away from the body with palms facing upwards. Move your head
        until you
        find a comfortable and relaxed position to rest it. Make sure you’re comfortable, as you shouldn’t move once
        you’re in
        this posture. Take deep breaths, relax your mind and each body part, but don’t fall asleep! To come out of
        Shavasana,
        slowly move your fingers and toes, stretch your body – legs pointing downwards, arms pointing outwards, and
        torso
        expanding – while moving your head gently. Turn to any one side and then get into a cross-legged sitting
        position.</p>
